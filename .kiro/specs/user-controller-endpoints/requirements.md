# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing user controller by adding comprehensive CRUD endpoints for user management. Currently, the system only supports user creation. This enhancement will provide complete user management capabilities including retrieving, updating, and deleting users, along with listing functionality for administrative purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to retrieve a specific user by their ID, so that I can display user information in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/users/{id}` with a valid user ID THEN the system SHALL return the user data with HTTP 200 status
2. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/users/{id}` with an invalid user ID THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 status with appropriate error message
3. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/users/{id}` with malformed ID format THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 status with validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to retrieve a list of all users with pagination support, so that I can manage users efficiently without overwhelming the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/users` THEN the system SHALL return a paginated list of users with HTTP 200 status
2. WHEN pagination parameters (page, limit) are provided THEN the system SHALL return the appropriate subset of users
3. WHEN no pagination parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL use default pagination values (page=1, limit=10)
4. WHEN invalid pagination parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 status with validation error
5. WHEN the requested page exceeds available data THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with appropriate metadata

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to update an existing user's information, so that I can modify user details when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PUT request is made to `/api/users/{id}` with valid user data THEN the system SHALL update the user and return the updated user data with HTTP 200 status
2. WHEN a PUT request is made to `/api/users/{id}` with an invalid user ID THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 status
3. WHEN a PUT request is made to `/api/users/{id}` with invalid data THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 status with validation errors
4. WHEN a PUT request attempts to update email to an already existing email THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 409 status with conflict error
5. WHEN a PUT request attempts to update username to a reserved username THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 status with validation error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to delete a user from the system, so that I can remove inactive or unwanted user accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DELETE request is made to `/api/users/{id}` with a valid user ID THEN the system SHALL delete the user and return HTTP 204 status
2. WHEN a DELETE request is made to `/api/users/{id}` with an invalid user ID THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 status
3. WHEN a DELETE request is made to `/api/users/{id}` with malformed ID format THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 status with validation error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation for all user endpoints, so that I can integrate with the API effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the Swagger documentation THEN all user endpoints SHALL be properly documented with request/response schemas
2. WHEN viewing endpoint documentation THEN each endpoint SHALL include example requests and responses
3. WHEN viewing endpoint documentation THEN all possible HTTP status codes SHALL be documented with their meanings
4. WHEN viewing endpoint documentation THEN all request parameters and body fields SHALL be clearly described

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for all user operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with appropriate context
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with field-specific messages
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 status with generic error message while logging detailed error information
4. WHEN authentication/authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401/403 status with appropriate error message
